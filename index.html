    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>I think I'm going to treat this as an extension of Bashed Me. It'll be like a dump of a lot
      of interests and images.</p>

    <p>One of the things I've been thinking about a lot these days is Bloodborne. It's a really cool but very
       difficult game. Sadly I don't own a PS4 so I rarely get to play it, but it's always a blast.</p>

    <p>Here's a picture of one of the coolest characters so far, and also a really tough boss.</p>
