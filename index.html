      <h1>Hello World!</h1>

      <p>I think I'm going to treat this as an extension of Bashed Me. It'll be like a dump of a lot
        of interests and images.</p>

      <p>One of the things I've been thinking about a lot these days is Bloodborne. It's a really cool but very
         difficult game. Sadly I don't own a PS4 so I rarely get to play it, but it's always a blast.</p>

      <p>Here's a picture of one of the coolest characters so far, and also a really tough boss.</p>

      <p>He also has a really awesome orchestral theme. Part of the reason it wasn't annoying to die over and over is because the music was incredible.

      <p>Video game soundtracks can surprisingly hold a lot of gems. I think most people would consider it weird,
        but these are legitimate compositions they put together (usually on live instruments).</p>
