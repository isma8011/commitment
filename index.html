        <h1>Hello World!</h1>

        <p>I think I'm going to treat this as an extension of Bashed Me. It'll be like a dump of a lot
          of interests and images.</p>

        <p>One of the things I've been thinking about a lot these days is Bloodborne. It's a really cool but very
           difficult game. Sadly I don't own a PS4 so I rarely get to play it, but it's always a blast.</p>

        <p>Here's a picture of one of the coolest characters so far, and also a really tough boss.</p>

        <p>He also has a really awesome orchestral theme. Part of the reason it wasn't annoying to die over and over is because the music was incredible.

        <p>Video game soundtracks can surprisingly hold a lot of gems. I think most people would consider it weird,
          but these are legitimate compositions they put together (usually on live instruments).</p>

        <h1>Elden Ring</h1>

        <p>Aside from Bloodborne, I've been enjoying Elden Ring lately too. It's just as challenging in some ways,
          even if they added a lot of good features to make single player more bearable.</p>
